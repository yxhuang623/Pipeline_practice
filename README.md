# YXPipeline
Introduction
The YXPipeline was developed to accomplish reference-based alignments to create multi FASTA alignment of core genome SNPs (also called SNP “matrix” in this pipeline) for a given set of samples. This pipeline starts with the generation of VCF files which contain the high-quality SNPs for each sample. Then the “pseudo_sequence caller” will be conducted to determine all the core genome SNP positions and create a pseudo FASTA sequence using bases at core genome positions. After generating the SNP “matrix”, the multi FASTA alignment could be used to build the phylogenetic tree.
This pipeline focuses on the closely-related pathogens, which means that it’s not suitable for those distantly related organisms. This software was developed with the goal to help distinguish which pathogen genomes are more likely to be outbreak-associated and which are less likely to be associated. Such a tool may be useful for answer some certain evolutionary questions and trace food safety investigations.
The YXPipeline is completely written in Python. The code is designed to be easy to read and modified as necessary. The important parameters of used tools such as BWA and Varscan are able to be changed directly in the python script, depending on the input data sets.
